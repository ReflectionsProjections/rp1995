<H1>What's in it for the Students</H1>

Student conference registrants will be able to attend any/all speakers, tours,
and panel discussions.  Registrants will also be able to attend a 
corporation expo where businesses will have booths to explain their companies
and will be accepting resumes.  Finally, all registrants will be able
to submit a one page resume which will be placed into a resume book which
will be distributed to the corporate sponsors as well as other companies
interested in the resume book.
