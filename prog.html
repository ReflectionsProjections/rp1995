Everything here is summarized in this handy
<A HREF="mechmania.html">fact sheet</A>.
<P>
<H2>All available team slots are now full. Thanks for your interest.</H2?
<P>
This year's programming contest is basically an advanced game of
capture the flag, only this time the flag is an armored  base, and you
don't need to bother capturing it... simply blowing it to dust will do.
<P>
The winning team will receive an 
<A HREF="prizes.html">awesome stack of X books</A> from our 
programming contest 
sponsor <strong><A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly & 
Associates</A></strong>. <P>
Mech Mania - "It's Stompin' Time" will provide the opportunity for up to
twelve teams of three people each to out wit each other on the game field.
We will provide a networked game server and a basic network game client.
Each team will have one day to write C++ classes that override the
default Mech behaviors.
<P>
The first task of your code will be to choose an army of Scout, Light, and 
Heavy Mechs, and armor your base with a given number of resource points.
You can override behaviors for all of the Mechs, or you can modify behaviors
for each individual type of Mech.  Suggested behaviors include scouting the
position of the opponent's Mechs and base, guarding your own base, and 
attacking opponent's forces.
<P>
Team members should have good working knowledge of C++ classes and
virtual functions.  No networking or graphics knowledge is needed- all that 
code 
will be provided.  We hope to provide each team of three with at least two
UNIX workstations running the X Window System.  We will also provide a 
set of standard
development tools including g++, gdb, emacs, vi, etc.  Both student and
professional (or mixed) teams are welcome.
