<H1>What's in it for the Corporate Participants</H1>

Corporate registrants will be able to attend any/all speakers, tours and
panel discussions as the student registrants.  Corporate registrants
will also have the option of purchasing the compiled resume book of 
student attendees.  Corporations will have the option of purchasing
a booth at the expo which will allow the corporation to showcase themselves
to the conference attendees as well as all other students at the
Unversity of Illinois, and any other students who wish to attend.
