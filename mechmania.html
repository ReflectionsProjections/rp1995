<DT><strong>Overview:</strong></DT>
<DD>
  Programming contest teams will write C++ code to control their army
  of mechs in a futuristic game of 'capture the flag'.  Actually 
  capturing the flag is not a requirement -- simply blowing your opponents
  base to dust will suffice.  After a day of coding and debugging, teams
  will compete in an elimination tournament shown on a wall-sized
  projection screen.
</DD>
<BR><DT><strong>What you need to know:</strong></DT>
<DD>
  C++ programming experience is expected.  All C++ classes and game engine
  code will be provided -- your team must code the methods that handle

  mechs during the game.  One or two complete sample clients will be
  provided.
